        And there I was, in a state of total shock and disbelief. I had made a
        complete and utter fool of myself. I had unknowingly made a critical
        error in the process of seeking a career. It was truly unforgivable. My
        whole life on this Earth, I have been training in the art of producing
        potassium using nothing but my bare hands. It had completely taken over
        my mind. My soul. My being. I let nothing get in the way of my training.
        But in the process, I forgot what it was like to live. I could no longer
        think rationally. I was an empty husk of the person that I could have
        been. I knew at that moment, I had truly let down the people closest to
        me. But deep down, they likely didn't care at all, because I pushed them
        aside for what I thought was important. But instead, this so-called
        importance led to my ultimate downfall. My many years of training had
        concluded with a mental breakdown. One could say...
